            I help children, adolescents, adults, caregivers, and people wanting
            to grow their families. I have a wealth of experience, training, and
            knowledge in many areas, and my goals are to work with my client to
            reach their highest potential. My therapeutic approach is focused on
            a collaborative effort to identify individual strengths and needs,
            develop meaningful goals, and to explore the necessary steps to
            attain those goals. My approach leads to increased self-esteem,
            learning, and attaining the supports that are out there â€” and
            teaching you to learn how to transition to a positive lens.
